# Zoomie

#### An Innovative DMV Automation Web Application.

Created by Patric Khiev in October 2018.

A mock example where users can get a replacement Drivers License or State ID by simply upload a photo of their DL or State ID Card. The goal of this application was to make it painless for the user.

The project goal was met in creating a scanner feature where users can simply upload an image of their credentials versus having to fill out a 20+ question form. However the form wizard was a necessary evil and apart of the MVP plan -- should the user lose their ID or it became too mangled to scan.

## Preplanning

### Wireframing

In retrospect, wire-framing was probably the most fruitful planning tool used for this project. It allowed me to see the totality of the project revise features, and scale back features as necessary.

Below is a visual of the plan of attack.

Initially, I used Adobe XD to mock up some views.
